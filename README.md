# AI Fundamentals Toolkit

This is a collection of Python scripts and experiments covering core topics in Artificial Intelligence.

Most of the work is self-contained. Each folder includes the code (and sometimes the problem context) for a specific topic.

## Usage

Each topic is in its own folder (e.g. `agents/`, `genetic_algorithms/`, etc.). You can run most scripts directly using:

```bash
python topic_folder/your_script.py
